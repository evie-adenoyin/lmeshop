An online ordering system i built for my school
This web application runs an authentication ( Register, login and logout )
Students have an e-wallet, where they have their funds saved.. I am yet to integrate a payment system like PAYPAL or STRIPE ect
students can add to cart, remove from cart and also speicify the location around campus they want their items delivered to
Students get an invoice downloaded for every transaction order they make
I will be adding a finger print authentication as well in due time
Staff can also go online and place their orders
Workers at all selling points will get notifications on orders placed with their items in them
I will also add a delivery system for delivery riders to get prompted on orders made by students
